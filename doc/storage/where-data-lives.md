# Where Klaw Data Lives

## Configuration

**Base path:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/klaw/` (typically `~/.config/klaw/`)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gateway.yaml` | Gateway configuration: channels, tokens, allowedChatIds, commands |
| `engine.yaml` | Engine configuration: LLM providers, models, routing, memory, scheduling, code execution |

Configuration files are read-only from the agent's perspective. The user must edit them directly.

---

## Conversations

**Path:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/klaw/conversations/{chatId}/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
(typically `~/.local/share/klaw/conversations/`)

- One JSONL file per day per chat
- Append-only; never modified after writing
- Written exclusively by the Gateway process
- Example: `conversations/telegram_123456/2026-02-24.jsonl`
- Each line is a JSON object with `id`, `ts`, `role`, `content` fields
- Role is `"user"` for incoming messages, `"assistant"` for engine replies

---

## Summaries

**Path:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/klaw/summaries/{chatId}/YYYY-MM-DD_msg_{from}_{to}.md`
(typically `~/.local/share/klaw/summaries/`)

- Human-readable Markdown summaries of conversation segments
- Generated by background summarization (post-MVP feature)
- Also indexed in archival memory for long-term retrieval

---

## Core Memory

**Path:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/klaw/memory/core_memory.json`
(typically `~/.local/share/klaw/memory/core_memory.json`)

- Structured JSON; read and written via memory tools
- Can be hand-edited when Engine is stopped
- Contains persistent facts the agent maintains across sessions

---

## Skills

**System skills path:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/klaw/skills/`
(typically `~/.local/share/klaw/skills/`)

- Skills installed system-wide
- Lower priority than workspace skills with the same name when names collide

**Workspace skills path:** `$KLAW_WORKSPACE/skills/`

- Skills specific to the active workspace
- Take priority over system skills

---

## Databases

| File | Owner | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| `~/.local/share/klaw/klaw.db` | Engine (exclusive) | Messages, sessions, vector embeddings (sqlite-vec), FTS5 indexes |
| `~/.local/share/klaw/scheduler.db` | Engine (exclusive) | Quartz scheduler jobs and triggers |

Both databases are caches/indexes only. The source of truth is the JSONL files. Databases can be rebuilt via `klaw reindex`.

---

## Sockets and Buffers

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.local/state/klaw/engine.sock` | Unix domain socket; exists only while Engine is running; permissions `600` |
| `~/.local/state/klaw/gateway-buffer.jsonl` | Messages buffered by Gateway when Engine was unavailable; drained automatically on reconnect |

If `engine.sock` does not exist, Engine is not running. Start it with:

```bash
systemctl --user start klaw-engine
# or directly:
klaw-engine
```

---

## Logs

**Path:** `~/.local/state/klaw/logs/`

```bash
# View recent Engine logs
tail -f ~/.local/state/klaw/logs/engine.log

# View recent Gateway logs
tail -f ~/.local/state/klaw/logs/gateway.log
```

---

## Model Cache

**Path:** `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/klaw/models/` (typically `~/.cache/klaw/models/`)

- ONNX model files (~80 MB for all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Managed automatically by Engine on first startup
- Safe to delete; re-downloaded on next Engine start

---

## Workspace

**Path:** `$KLAW_WORKSPACE` (default `~/klaw-workspace/`)

The agent has read/write access here via file tools. Standard workspace files:

| File/Dir | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent identity and values |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Working identity for the current context |
| `AGENTS.md` | Subagent definitions |
| `MEMORY.md` | Active working memory |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Heartbeat log |
| `skills/` | Workspace-local skills |
| `memory/` | Additional memory files |

The agent cannot read or write files outside this directory via file tools (path traversal protection).
