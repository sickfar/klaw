# How Scheduling Works

## Architecture

Quartz runs **inside the Engine process** — not as a separate service. Scheduled tasks are stored in `scheduler.db` (SQLite) and survive engine restarts.

```
Engine process
├── MessageProcessor      ← handles user messages
├── KlawSchedulerImpl     ← Quartz wrapper
│   └── QuartzKlawScheduler
│       └── Quartz JobStoreTX → scheduler.db
└── ScheduledMessageJob   ← fired by Quartz, calls MessageProcessor directly
```

No additional processes or daemons are needed. Quartz uses 2 background threads for job execution.

---

## What happens when a task fires

1. Quartz triggers `ScheduledMessageJob` on a background thread.
2. Engine spawns a subagent coroutine with isolated context (separate from the main chat session).
3. The subagent runs the configured `message` as an LLM call with the configured `model`.
4. The result is optionally delivered to a user via `injectInto`.

The call is **in-process** — no IPC, no socket, no network hop.

---

## Subagent context for scheduled tasks

A scheduled subagent receives:
- Shared system prompt (same as main agent)
- Shared system prompt (including USER.md)
- Last 5 messages from its own scheduler channel log

A scheduled subagent does **not** see:
- The main chat's recent messages
- Other conversation sessions

This is intentional. Heartbeat tasks should not depend on conversation state — they run independently and report their findings.

---

## Delivering results to the user

If `injectInto` is set:
1. The subagent completes its LLM run.
2. Engine checks the result for `{"silent": true}`.
3. If not silent: Engine sends the result to Gateway → user receives it in their chat.
4. If silent: result is logged only. No notification.

If `injectInto` is `null`: result is logged only.

---

## Misfire recovery

If Engine was stopped and missed scheduled fires, Quartz applies the **FireAndProceed** policy on startup:
- The task fires **once**, regardless of how many triggers were missed.
- It does not replay all missed triggers (no flooding on long downtime).

The misfire threshold is 60 seconds. Tasks missed by less than 60 seconds are not considered misfired.

## Managing tasks

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `schedule_add` tool | Add a task at runtime |
| `schedule_remove` tool | Remove a task at runtime |
| `schedule_list` tool | List all active tasks |
| `klaw schedule add` CLI | Add a task from the command line |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Declare tasks in workspace; imported at startup |

Changes via `schedule_add`/`schedule_remove` take effect immediately. Changes to `HEARTBEAT.md` take effect on next engine restart.
