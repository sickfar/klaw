# Recall Memory

## What recall memory is

Recall memory is the last N messages from the current segment, automatically included in every context assembly. N is `slidingWindow` from `engine.json` (default: 20 messages).

## Segment boundary

Only messages since the last `/new` command are in the sliding window. Messages before `/new` are preserved in the JSONL log on disk but are not included in context.

## What counts as a message

Each of the following is one message slot in the sliding window:
- A user message
- An assistant response
- A tool call (assistant turn)
- A tool result (tool turn)

A single tool call + result pair uses two window slots.

## When the window shrinks

If N messages exceed the remaining context budget after fixed sections are placed, the window shrinks silently to fit. No notification is sent to the user. Oldest messages are dropped first.

## Accessing messages outside the window

Use `memory_search` to retrieve content from older messages. Conversation summaries (when generated by the summarization task) are indexed in archival memory and findable via `memory_search`.
